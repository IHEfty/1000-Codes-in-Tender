### `gb.td`
This script is embedding the contents of a text file named `gumball.txt`. The function `sysout embed("gumball.txt")` likely outputs the contents of that file to the terminal.

### `gumball.td`
This script contains a lot of ANSI escape codes for coloring the text output. It seems to be designed to create a visual representation, possibly simulating a gumball machine or something similar. Hereâ€™s a simplified analysis:

- The escape codes (`\x1b[0;37m`, `\x1b[0;31m`, `\x1b[0;91m`, etc.) are used to change the text color in the terminal.
- The use of special characters like `+`, `#`, `%`, and `*` along with line breaks (`\n`) creates a pattern or image in the terminal, likely resembling gumballs or a gumball machine interface.

### Suggestions for Usage
1. **Running the Scripts**: You can execute these scripts in your terminal with the Tender programming language interpreter. Make sure both `gumball.td` and `gumball.txt` are in the same directory when you run `tender gb.td`.

2. **Creating `gumball.txt`**: If you want the `gumball.txt` file to provide specific content or configurations for your gumball machine, you should create it with the desired text or data.

3. **Visual Enhancements**: You might consider adding more colors or symbols to enhance the visual appeal of the output. Adjusting the sequence of colors and characters can make it look more dynamic.

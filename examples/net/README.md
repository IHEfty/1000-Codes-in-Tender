# Network Communication Example in Tender

This project demonstrates network operations like DNS lookups, TCP/UDP address resolution, and establishing a TCP connection using Tender's **net** module. It includes sending an HTTP request and receiving the response from a server.

## Overview

- **DNS Lookup**: Resolves domain names (e.g., `example.com`).
- **TCP/UDP Address Resolution**: Resolves network addresses for specified domains.
- **TCP Connection**: Establishes a connection, sends an HTTP GET request, and reads the response.

### How It Works

1. **DNS Lookup**: Retrieves IP addresses for a domain name.
2. **Address Resolution**: Resolves TCP/UDP addresses for the domain.
3. **TCP Connection**: Connects to the server and sends an HTTP GET request.
4. **Response**: Receives the server's response and closes the connection.

You can customize the host and request data as needed.

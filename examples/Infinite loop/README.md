# Infinite Loop Demo  

The **Infinite Loop Demo** is part of **1000+ Codes in Tender**, showcasing how to create and control an infinite loop in **Tender**.  

## How It Works  

The script runs a loop that increments a counter and prints it continuously. The loop can be stopped at a specific value by modifying a condition inside the script. Uncommenting the `break` statement will allow it to exit at the defined point.  

## Running the Demo  

Run the script with:  

```bash
tender infinite_loop.td
```  

Modify the loop condition to change when it stops. Explore and tweak the code in **1000+ Codes in Tender** to learn more!

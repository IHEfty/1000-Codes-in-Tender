## Features

- Visualizes sine and cosine waves.
- Customizable wave parameters (amplitude, frequency, color).
- Real-time updates with window resizing support.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Save the script as `waves.td`.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
tender waves.td
```

## How It Works

- **Drawing Axes**: The script draws X and Y axes with tick marks.
- **Drawing Waves**: It plots sine and cosine waves using custom math functions, with color and amplitude control.
- **Resizing**: The window automatically adjusts and redraws when resized.

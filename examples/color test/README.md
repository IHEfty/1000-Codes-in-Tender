# Color Test in Tender

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate and manipulate RGB color values using the **Tender** scripting language. It includes two scripts:

### 1. `col_test.td`
- Generates a spectrum of RGB colors by iterating through all combinations of red, green, and blue (0â€“255).
- Displays each color in the console with ANSI escape codes.

### 2. `col_test_2.td`
- Enhances the first script by adding random strings and improving console formatting.
- Organizes colors into a structured output, adding spaces and new lines for readability.

## Usage

- Run the scripts using `tender col_test.td` or `tender col_test_2.td`.
- The console will display a range of colors, with the second script showing better formatting and added random text.

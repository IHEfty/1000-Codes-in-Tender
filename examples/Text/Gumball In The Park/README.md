# Dialogue Text Animation in Tender  

This repository showcases a text animation effect using [**Tender**](https://github.com/2dprototype/tender). The script reads dialogue from `dialogue.txt` and displays it with a typing effect, adding random delays for a natural reading pace.  

## How It Works  
- Reads text from `dialogue.txt`.  
- Displays it in the console with a simulated typing effect.  
- Randomizes delays between characters and words for realism.  

Run it using:  
```bash
tender main.td
```  
Ensure `dialogue.txt` is in the same directory. Modify it for custom animations!

Dude, when we get done raking these leaves, we should go watch a movie and order a pizza.

You read my mind.

Looking good, boys.
Looking very good indeed.
You both have done such a good job today.
Don't see why you couldn't give yourself a little reward, right?

Look like the day off?

How about a gumball?

I don't think.

Unless, unless you both think that you haven't been doing a good job, and if that's the case, maybe I should,
maybe I should just let you go.

I hate to fire you because in my eyes, you both have been doing so well.

We've been trying our best.

Jolly good show, jolly good show.

Yeah, we've been working hard lately, Benson.

I know you boys have.
That's why I want to spoil you with a little treat.

Charlie, jolly good show.

Go on, go on, and get yourself one.
Better spit on those fingers.
These old hands aren't getting any younger.
Just a little spin for both of us.
Uh-oh, looks like somebody got a reward.

I'm gonna get back to work.

Rigby, you should smile more.
You look so much prettier when you smile.
Now, don't tell anyone I told you this,
but you're my favorite here.
I think you can go a long way in this company
if you were just a bit more of a team player.
Do you think you could be a team player for me, Rick B?
Oh, the cologne is intoxicating.

I don't think I want a gumball, Benson.
I should probably get back to work.

Come on, no one's looking. You've done so well that I think you deserve two gumballs.

I don't really...

If it's good for me,
it's good for you. There's one.
I think you have a great future here.
You're my number two, you know.
Hey, but don't tell anyone else that.
They'd probably get jealous.
Go on and take it. You deserve it.

Got your good, baby. Go on and get it.
Got your good, baby. Go on.
Go on and get it.
Go get back to work, but hey,
can you do me a favor?
Can you have a great day for me?

### Scooby-Doo Text Animation in Tender

This project demonstrates a text animation effect in Tender, where words from a subtitle file are displayed with a typing effect. It features color-coded text and dynamic delays between characters to simulate a real-time animation. The text is read from the `subtitle.txt` file, and color effects are applied using data from the `scooby0.txt` file.

**How it works:**
- The script reads and splits the subtitle file into words.
- It then displays each word with a typing animation, incorporating random delays between characters.
- Color changes are triggered by embedded color codes within the text.
- Finally, an embedded image (`scooby0.txt`) is shown after the animation.

To use the script, ensure the required files are present and run it with the `tender` command.

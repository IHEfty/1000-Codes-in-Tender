Alright, gang, we got the ghoul who's been scaring everyone at the ice cream shop. 
Let's go find the cops and get this crook booked so we can move on to our next mystery. 
Scoob, why don't you stay here in case he tries any funny business?
~iwhite~
You want to know how I would have gotten away with your crime? 
I would have killed the ice cream store owner, 
burned the tips of their fingers, 
and cut up their body into twelve tiny pieces, 
scattering them in the ocean and burying them deep in the woods. 

You got too showboaty with all your gimmicks.
~igreen~
As a fellow artist, I respect the work you've done,
~iwhite~
but you were weak. 
You were weak to leave the store owner alive.
~white~
Like, I got us a sandwich, man. 
Oh, look at him, he loves it! Steve loves his sandwiches. 
Oh, Scooby loves his sandwiches, don't you, buddy? 
Oh, come here, let me pet you, buddy. 
Scoob's got a big old ~ipurple~belly~white~, don't you, 
Scooby? Yes, you do. Look at you. 
Me and the gang wish Scooby was a girl so he could give him better ~ipurple~belly~white~ rubs. 
Oh, it's hard to rub Scooby's soft ~ipurple~belly~white~ without almost touching his ~iyellow~dinghy~white~... uh... oops.
Like I got it at the end there a bit, but well, I better be getting back. 
I'll talk to you later, Scoob.

~iwhite~
That was a close one. 
I almost got caught talking to you. 
Now, where was I? 
Oh, that's right, 
I'd not only kill the store owner, 
I'd kill the wife, 
the kids, 
the cousins, 
the aunts, 
and the uncles. 
Justice isn't pursued if there's no one seeking retribution. 
So I hop from town to town, 
acting like a smooth-brained dog who solves innocent cases 
involving small-town business owners like yourself. 
I'm only gonna live to be eight years old, 
hell, 
maybe nine. 
I plan on taking as many souls as I can to hell with me. 
~white~
Come on, Scoob, let's go solve more clues, buddy. 
~iwhite~
Looks like that's my call. 

On to the next town... ~ired~you know too much.

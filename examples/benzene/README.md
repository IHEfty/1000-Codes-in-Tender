# Benzene Drawing Example in Tender

This repository contains a `benzene.td` script that demonstrates how to draw a benzene ring using the [**Tender**](https://github.com/2dprototype/tender) canvas module. The script creates a hexagonal shape with customizable radius and line settings to represent the benzene structure.

## How It Works

The script uses the `canvas` and `math` modules to draw a benzene ring. It starts by creating a hexagon and then alternates lines based on the given parameters. You can adjust the radius, and the script offers flexibility in how the lines are drawn.

### Key Functions:
- `benzene()`: Draws the benzene ring with customizable radius and line configuration.
- `draw()`: Sets up the window, background color, and invokes the benzene function to display the structure.

## Usage

1. **Run**: `tender benzene.td` to execute the script.
2. **View**: A window will display the benzene ring.

 # Count Tender Scripts

The `count.td` script counts the total number of `.td` files in the current directory and subdirectories. It's a simple tool to help you organize and track your Tender script files.

## How It Works:
- It walks through the directory using the `path.walklist` function.
- It checks each fileâ€™s extension, counting only those with `.td`.
- It outputs the total count and lists the `.td` files.

**To run**: 
```bash
tender count.td
```

# Audio Test

The **Audio Test** project demonstrates how to play audio files using Tender's audio capabilities. It initializes the audio system, loads an audio file, and plays it while tracking the remaining playback time.

## How It Works

The `audio_test.td` script plays an audio file (e.g., `audio.mp3`) and prints the remaining playback time to the terminal. You can customize the audio file by replacing the filename in the `play` function.

Simply execute the script with Tender to see the audio playback in action. You can modify the file to play a different audio by specifying the desired filename.

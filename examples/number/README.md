# Number Operations

The **Number Operations** project is part of the **1000+ Codes in Tender** collection, showcasing numeric operations and type conversions using various numeric types in Tender.

## Overview

This project contains two scripts:

1. **num.td**: Compares different numeric types (`int`, `float`, `bigint`, `bigfloat`) and prints results for various comparisons.
2. **num1.td**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with different numeric types and logs the results.

## How It Works

- **num.td** iterates through combinations of numeric types, converts `x` and `y` to these types, and performs comparisons like greater than, less than, and equality.
  
- **num1.td** defines functions for arithmetic operations. It tests these operations with `100` and `55` using different numeric types and logs the results.

## Running the Projects

To run the projects, use the following commands:

```bash
tender num.td
tender num1.td
```
